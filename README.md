## DESCRIPTION

This PowerShell script automates the process of creating user accounts in Active Directory from a CSV file. 

It imports user data such as name, first name, last name, username, email, role, and password from a specified CSV file and creates corresponding user accounts in Active Directory with the specified attributes. 

Each user is placed in an Organizational Unit (OU) based on their role, and their account is enabled with a secure password. 

This tool streamlines the process of bulk user account creation, making it efficient and error-free.
